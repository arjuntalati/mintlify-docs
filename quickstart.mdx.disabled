## Get your first video in three steps

Start generating videos with Knowlify's APIs quickly and efficiently.

### Step 1: Get your API key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Sign up for Knowlify">
    1. Contact the Knowlify team for access
    2. Create your account or sign in
    3. Navigate to the API Keys section
    4. Generate your first API key
    
    <Warning>Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly!</Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="test-tube" title="Test your connection">
    Verify your API key works with a simple request:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.knowlify.com/v1/status" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    
    <Tip>You should receive a 200 OK response confirming your connection.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Generate your first video

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="zap" title="Try Live-gen (fastest)">
    Start with our fastest API for immediate results using WebSocket:
    
    ```javascript
    const websocket = new WebSocket("wss://50fa8sjxo9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/production");
    
    websocket.onopen = function() {
        const payload = {
            action: "finetuned_live_gen",
            task: "Welcome to Knowlify! This is my first generated video.",
            api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
        };
        websocket.send(JSON.stringify(payload));
    };
    ```
    
    Your video will be ready in 30-90 seconds!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="film" title="Or try Pre-rendered (highest quality)">
    For production-quality videos with animations:
    
    ```javascript
    const websocket = new WebSocket("wss://50fa8sjxo9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/production");
    
    websocket.onopen = function() {
        const payload = {
            action: "Pre-Rendered",
            task: "This is a high-quality video with beautiful animations.",
            api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
        };
        websocket.send(JSON.stringify(payload));
    };
    ```
    
    <Note>Pre-rendered videos take 5-8 minutes but offer superior quality.</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Monitor and download

<Accordion icon="download" title="Get your video">
  1. Use the job ID from the response to check status:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET "https://api.knowlify.com/v1/jobs/{job_id}" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```
  2. When status is `completed`, download your video from the `video_url`
  3. Share, embed, or use your generated video!
</Accordion>
