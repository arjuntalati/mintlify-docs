## Coming Soon

The Knowlify Python SDK is currently under development and will be available soon.

<Note>
  The Python SDK will provide a convenient way to interact with all Knowlify APIs directly from your Python applications.
</Note>

## Expected Installation

Once released, you'll be able to install the SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install knowlify
```

## Expected Usage

The SDK will support all three main API endpoints:

```python
import knowlify

# Initialize client
client = knowlify.Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Pre-rendered videos (high quality, slower)
video = client.pre_rendered.generate(
    script="Your video script here",
    # Additional parameters...
)

# Live generation (fast)
video = client.live_gen.generate(
    script="Your video script here",
    # Additional parameters...
)

# Modify existing videos
modified_video = client.modify.update(
    video_id="video-123",
    changes={...}
)
```

## Stay Updated

For now, please use our REST API directly. Check back soon for the Python SDK release!
